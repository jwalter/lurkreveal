# LurkReveal&trade;

## Summary

LurkReveal&trade; is a tool that you can open as a website to get a visual representation of what users are in your Twitch chat.

## Usage

- Go to https://matthewbrandt.github.io/lurkreveal
- Input your broadcaster username in the input field
- Enjoy!

## Categories & Colours
Each category has it's own colour, appropriately using the colours from the Twitch UI. If there are no chatters in that category in your stream, the category is hidden (e.g. "Staff").

### Known Bots
Bots are classified as such by multiple different websites in different ways. In general, it can be said that bots connect to multiple (10+) different chats via IRC directly and are therefore not watching your stream. There are currently `204'307` bots in the list here! If a bot is known for providing a particular service, see below.

### Digital Service
Some bots are connected to your chat because they provide a service like stream analyticy, or you even may have invited them there. If you have a bot that is misclassified, please reach out!

## More Information

The word `lurker` is commonly used within the Twitch community to loosely describe users that are hanging out in your channel, but are not speaking in chat.

There are _many_ reasons why a user may be in your stream and not chatting e.g.

- is away from keyboard (AFK)
- is on a phonecall and cannot write
- was part of a raid into your channel and is seeing a pre-roll ad
- doesn't feel confident in writing in your stream's language(s)
- ...is happy to just watch your stream!

The streamer must accept that _all_ of these reasons are legitimate reasons! It's not for the streamer to judge users for the way a user chooses to participate in the stream.

## Purpose

This is **not** a tool that is used for spying on Twitch users in your chat and calling them out for lurking. Twitch is fundamentally an open, caring community and appreciates that each person is unique in their own way.

LurkReveal&trade; tool is for streamers to see what users are in their chat for different reasons:

- keep an eye out for other streamers who may be friends, potential incoming raids, etc.
- monitor against potential hate raids or other hate events
- understand overall chat engagement compared to all users in chat
- easily identify bot accounts (and deal with them consequently as desired)
- etc.
